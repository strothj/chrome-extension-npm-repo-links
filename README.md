# NPM to Github Search Results

A simple chrome extension which adds a link to Google search results pointing
to a NPM package's source control repository.

While the name says Github, it actually will work with any repository link.

When viewing a Google search results page which contains links to packages
on npmjs.com, links will be added to the search results to their source control
repositories if they exist.
